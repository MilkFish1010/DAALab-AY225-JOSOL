# ArfArf Sort - Dog-Themed Sorting Algorithm Analyzer

A fun, dog-themed GUI application for analyzing sorting algorithms. Built with Python and Tkinter.

## Features

- **Prelim Lab 1**: Bubble Sort analysis with 10,000 elements
- **Prelim Lab 2**: Compare Bubble, Insertion, and Merge Sort algorithms
- **Prelim Exam**: CSV sorting with column selection and benchmarking

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Required packages: `pip install tk`

## Labs Included

### Lab 1: Bubble Sort
This lab helps you understand how the Bubble Sort method works by sorting a list of numbers. You can either create your own list of 10,000 numbers or load one from a file. The app will sort the numbers and show you how long it took, plus check if everything is sorted correctly. It's a great way to see sorting in action step by step.

### Lab 2: Algorithm Comparison
Here, you can compare three different ways to sort numbers: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. Pick the sorting method you want to try, choose how many numbers to sort, and see how each one performs. This lab shows you the differences in speed and helps you learn which method might be better for different situations.

### Exam: CSV Sorting
In this lab, you'll work with a big file of data (like a list of people with IDs and names). The app loads a file with 100,000 entries and lets you sort them by ID, first name, or last name. You can choose how many rows to sort and see the results, including how fast it was done. It's useful for organizing large amounts of information.
