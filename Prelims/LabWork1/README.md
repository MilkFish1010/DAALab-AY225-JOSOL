# Prelim Lab 1: Bubble Sort Analysis

## What This Lab Is About
This lab introduces you to Bubble Sort, a simple way to arrange numbers in order. You'll work with a list of 10,000 numbers and see how the sorting process works. It's like organizing a pile of toys by comparing them one by one and swapping if they're out of order.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Start the App**: Open the application. It will automatically look for data files in the `data` folder.
2. **Choose Your Data**:
   - **Auto-load**: The app will try to load a file from the `data` folder automatically.
   - **Load Selected**: Pick a file from the dropdown list of available data files.
   - **Import**: Click "Import TXT" to choose a text file with numbers (one number per line).
   - **Generate**: Click "Generate" to create a random list of numbers. Enter the size (like 10000) and click the button.
3. **Set Options**:
   - Check "Timer" if you want to see how long it takes (note: this might slow things down).
   - Check "Show Progress Bar" to watch the sorting progress.
   - Check "Show first 10 only" to display just the first 10 sorted numbers instead of all.
   - Choose "Ascending" (smallest to largest) or "Descending" (largest to smallest).
4. **Run the Sort**: Click "Run Sort" to start. You can stop it anytime with the "Stop" button.
5. **View Results**: The app will show the sorted list, time taken, and confirm if it's sorted correctly.
6. **Export**:
   - "Export Report" saves the full results to a text file.
   - "Export Data" saves just the sorted numbers to a text file.

## What You'll See
- A list of your sorted numbers.
- How long the sorting took.
- A check to make sure everything is in the right order.
- Progress updates if you enabled them.

## Tips
- Start with a smaller dataset if you're new to this.
- Importing your own data is fun – try a list of ages or scores.
- The progress bar helps you see how sorting is going, but it can make it slower.
- If sorting takes too long, try stopping and using fewer numbers.
