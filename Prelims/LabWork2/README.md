# Prelim Lab 2: Algorithm Comparison

## What This Lab Is About
This lab lets you compare three different sorting methods: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. Each method sorts numbers in its own way, and you'll see how they differ in speed. It's like testing different tools for the same job to see which one works best for your needs.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Start the App**: Launch the application for Lab 2.
2. **Choose the Algorithm**: Select from the dropdown: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Merge Sort.
3. **Set the Dataset Size**: Enter how many numbers you want to sort (e.g., 1000, 10000).
4. **Run the Comparison**: Click "Run Comparison" to start sorting with your chosen method and size.
5. **View the Results**: The app will show the sorted list, how long it took, and confirm if it's correct.
6. **Try Different Options**: Change the algorithm or size and run again to compare.

## What You'll See
- The sorted numbers.
- Time taken to sort.
- A check that the sorting was done right.
- You can compare times for different methods to see which is faster.

## Tips
- Start with smaller sizes to see quick results.
- Bubble Sort is simple but slow for big lists.
- Merge Sort is usually the fastest for large amounts of data.
- Use this to understand why some sorting methods are better than others.
